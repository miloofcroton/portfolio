    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>
      This site is designed to be a single website that can house pretty much everything I want to publically publish on the internet
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Work</strong> section is for my professional connections. I list the projects that I've worked on (searchable by keyword) and give a brief overview of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Play</strong> section is for me to upload cool pics from my travels, cooking failures, and other odds and ends. Basically, my own personal Instagram.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Thoughts</strong> section is for me to publish my ideas on a wide range of things, technical mostly but perhaps some non-technical things too. It shows a most recent section for my posts on load, but you can also drill into a hierarchy that I created for these posts because I love hierarchies.
